## Results and Insights

1. **Decreased Conversion Rates**:
   - **General Conversion Trend**: Conversion rates varied throughout the year, with peaks in February and July. There is potential to improve conversions during low-performing months, such as May, by revisiting marketing strategies or promotions.
   - **Lowest Conversion Month**: May had the lowest conversion rate at 4.3%, with no products standing out significantly. This suggests that targeted interventions are needed during this period.
   - **Highest Conversion Rates**: January recorded the highest conversion rate at 17.3%, driven by Ski Boots, which had a remarkable 100% conversion rate. This indicates seasonal demand and effective marketing strategies in January.

2. **Reduced Customer Engagement**:
   - Overall social media engagement has declined, with views dropping throughout the year. However, the click-through rate stands at 19.56%, indicating that engaged users are still interacting effectively despite low interaction rates in terms of likes and comments.

3. **Customer Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Ratings Distribution**: The majority of customer reviews are positive, with 431 reviews at 4 stars and 409 at 5 stars. However, 1-2 star reviews still account for a smaller proportion, indicating areas for improvement.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive sentiment dominates with 840 reviews, while negative sentiment is present in 226 reviews. The presence of mixed sentiments indicates opportunities to convert these experiences into more positive feedback.
